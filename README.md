# Daily Coding Challenges

I signed up for daily coding challenges from [this site] in an attempt to prepare for coding interviews. Every day a new challenge is sent via email with a short description of the problem.

I will put my solutions to the problem in a folder labeled with the challenge's date. Most solutions will be in Python.

I will also try to provide a simple solution (which may be inefficient), and a more optimized solution to help with time complexity.
